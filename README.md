Derived from the D3.js example [force_cluster.html](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/master/examples/force/force-cluster.html)

Usage
-----

* Click on node to expand or collapse.
* Click on hull (which shows up when you expanded a group node) to collapse the group.
* Drag node to move entire graph around.

Notes
-----

* `network()` is the one who takes care of (re)generating the nodes and links from the original data, based on the `expand[]` info, i.e. which group(s) should be shown in expanded form and which shouldn't.

* only _group_ nodes are expected to a `.size` attribute (read: your own JSON should use that attribute for any node). Same goes for the fields `.group_data` and `.link_count`: all of these are expected to be generated by the `network()` call. (`.group_data` is a reference to the group (x/y/size/link_count) for a node, `group_node.link_count` counts the number of links _between_ _groups_.)

* you'll very probably have to tweak `.gravity`, `.charge`, `.linkDistance` and maybe also `.linkStrength` to make your own graphs look good. Compare the final layout of this graph with the ones produced by the v2.9.6 force_cluster.html D3 code: note the generally quite different position of the groups which have only a single link to other groups; that and other differences are all due to the 4 aforementioned `force` parameters.
